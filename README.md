# Norix-UI
Attendance web app built with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react">React</a> that consumes data from the <a href="https://github.com/busla/norix-api">Norix-API</a>. This project will not serve any purpose unless you scrape the data with <a href="https://github.com/busla/norix-scraper">Norix-scraper</a> and setup the Norix-api.

The app offers the coach to take attendance on scraped seminars and their athletes.
